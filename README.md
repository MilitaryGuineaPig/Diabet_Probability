Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
I made a Diabet probability (Accuracy 96%) app based on your blood test!

The Diabetes Prediction Program is an app designed to help individuals predict the probability of having diabetes based on their personal information. This app requires users to enter their gender, age, hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, BMI, HbA1c level, and current blood glucose level. Once all the required fields are filled, users can click on the "Result" button to get their diabetes probability percentage.

It's important to note that this prediction is based on a statistical model and should not be used as a substitute for medical advice. Individuals who are concerned about their health should consult a healthcare professional. All fields are required to ensure the accuracy of the prediction. The result will be displayed in the "Result" field.

This app is useful for individuals who want to have an idea of their probability of having diabetes and can take necessary actions for prevention or seek medical attention. It can be accessed easily on GitHub and can be used on any device with internet access.
